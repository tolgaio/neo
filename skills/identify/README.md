## About DSRP

Four of these skills are based on the DSRP framework (Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives), a systems thinking methodology developed by Derek Cabrera. These patterns help analyze complex topics through different lenses inspired by prominent systems thinkers including Russell Ackoff, Peter Senge, Donella Meadows, Gregory Bateson, and Jay Forrester.
