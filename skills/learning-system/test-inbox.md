## To Process

### Kubernetes & Networking
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Omvgd7Hg1I
- [ ] https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
- [ ] I need to understand how service mesh handles mTLS and certificate rotation. This is critical for our microservices architecture.

### LLM & AI Agents

- [ ] https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-v0-2-2/
- [ ] Been thinking about building an AI agent that can help with code reviews. Need to understand tool calling and function schemas better.

### Rust Programming
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJTDTyNdJdY
- [ ] https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/
- [ ] async/await in Rust is confusing. How do I properly handle concurrent operations without blocking?

### Random Topics
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Y0bnx6Ndw
- [ ] Effective note-taking strategies for technical learning

## Notes

Some general thoughts:
- I've been collecting these resources over the past few weeks
- The Kubernetes stuff is urgent for work project
- The Rust content is more exploratory - might start a side project
- LLM agents tie into both work and personal interests
